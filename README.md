## Running the application

- (Optional) Create a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- Clone the repo to ensure you have it locally
- If you already have pyswip installed, uninstall it with `pip uninstall pyswip`
- Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify the pyswip version installed is from the github master. Running `pip freeze` should include

```
pyswip @ git+https://github.com/yuce/pyswip@59016e0841f56177d1b18ec08fd9b67792bd0a97
